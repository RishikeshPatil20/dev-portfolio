//  src/models/

//  This directory is reserved for defining Mongoose schemas (or other ODM/ORM models)
//  if this application were to interact with a persistent database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL).

//  For the current version of the portfolio, data is fetched from static JavaScript files
//  located in 'src/utils/' (e.g., blogsData.js, projectsData.js).

//  Future Updates:
//  - If dynamic content creation/management (e.g., an admin panel for blogs/projects) is added.
//  - If contact form submissions need to be stored in a database.
//  - If user authentication or other persistent data storage becomes necessary.

//  In such cases, this directory would contain files like:
//  - BlogPost.js (Mongoose schema for blog posts)
//  - Project.js (Mongoose schema for projects)
//  - ContactSubmission.js (Mongoose schema for form data)
